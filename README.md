_____

## üöÄ Installation

### Slime Mod Manager

Download the latest version of this mod from the [Slime Mod Manager](https://github.com/legoandmars/SlimeModManager/releases/latest)!

### Manually

*If your game isn't modded with BepinEx, DO THAT FIRST!*
Simply go to the [latest BepinEx release](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and extract `BepinEx_x64_VERSION.zip` directly into your game's folder, then run the game once to install BepinEx properly.

Next, go to the [latest release of this mod](https://github.com/megalon/NickCustomMusicMod/releases/latest) and extract the zip in your game's install directory.

This will place the dll in `BepInEx\plugins\`, and then create the `BepInEx\CustomSongs\*` folder structure.

## ‚Ñπ Usage

### Folder structure
```
BepInEx
    ‚Ü≥ CustomSongs
        ‚Ü≥ Menus
            ‚Ü≥ ArcadeMap
            ‚Ü≥ LoseV1
              ...
        ‚Ü≥ Stages
            ‚Ü≥ CatDogs House
            ‚Ü≥ Glove World
              ...
        ‚Ü≥ Victory Themes
            ‚Ü≥ Aang
            ‚Ü≥ April
              ...
```

Place `.wav`, `.ogg`, or `.mp3` files into the folder corresponding to the stage or menu you want to change.

For example, if you want to use a different song for the Jellyfish Fields stage, place the audio file in `BepInEx\CustomSongs\Stages\Jellyfish Fields`

If multiple audio files are in the same folder, one is randomly selected each time that stage / menu is loaded!

## üìù Configuration

**Run the game once with the mod installed to generate the config file:**

`BepInEx\config\megalon.nick_custom_music_mod.cfg`

Simply edit this file in a text editor, and save it, then launch the game again.

| Setting | Possible Values | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| `Use Default Songs` | `true` or `false` | `true` will include the built-in songs when the mod is randomly selecting a song to play. |


## ‚ùî FAQ

### "My .mp3 didn't work!"
I've had multiple people unable to load certain mp3 files.

If you've downloaded a file from a youtube downloader, such as `ytmp3.cc`, your file might actually be an `.m4a` disguised as a `.mp3`

Unity cannot load these (it seems).

Use a different converter, or convert to `.ogg` instead! Thanks.

### "What happens if I have multiple songs in the same folder?"

The mod will randomly select a song to play each time that stage / menu / victory is loaded.

### "Can I include the default songs in the random selection?"

Yes. You must enable the option in the config file. See "Config File" above.

## üîß Developing

Clone the project, then create a file in the root of the project directory named:

`NickCustomMusicMod.csproj.user`

Here you need to set the `GameDir` property to match your install directory.

Example:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <GameDir>D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl</GameDir>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Now when you build the mod, it should resolve your references automatically, and the build event will copy the plugin into your `BepInEx\plugins` folder!
