## üöÄ Installation

### Slime Mod Manager

Download the latest version of this mod from the [Slime Mod Manager](https://github.com/legoandmars/SlimeModManager/releases/latest)!

## ‚Ñπ Usage

### Folder structure
```
BepInEx
    ‚Ü≥ CustomSongs
        ‚Ü≥ Menus
            ‚Ü≥ ArcadeMap
            ‚Ü≥ LoseV1
              ...
        ‚Ü≥ Stages
            ‚Ü≥ CatDogs House
            ‚Ü≥ Glove World
              ...
        ‚Ü≥ Victory Themes
            ‚Ü≥ Aang
            ‚Ü≥ April
              ...
```

Place `.wav`, `.ogg`, or `.mp3` files into the folder corresponding to the stage or menu you want to change.

For example, if you want to use a different song for the Jellyfish Fields stage, place the audio file in `BepInEx\CustomSongs\Stages\Jellyfish Fields`

If multiple audio files are in the same folder, one is randomly selected each time that stage / menu is loaded!

### ‚ü≤ Loop points *(optional)*

To define a loop start and end point, create a JSON file in the same folder as your audio file, and give it the same name as your audio file.

A JSON file is just a regular text file, but instead of `.txt` it is `.json`

You may need to [turn on file extensions on Windows](https://fileinfo.com/help/windows_10_show_file_extensions) to be able to see and edit the `.json` extension.

**File structure example**
```
Stages
    ‚Ü≥ Jellyfish Fields
        ‚Ü≥ Song1.wav
        ‚Ü≥ Song1.json
```

**JSON file contents**
```json
{
  "loopStartPointSec": "16.109",
  "loopEndPointSec": "62.215"
}
```

When `62.215` seconds have elapsed in the song, it will loop back to `16.109` seconds!

To find loop points in your song, you can use some free audio software like [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).

I would recommend using a DAW with more precise BPM / looping support, such as Reaper, Ableton Live, FL Studio, etc.

## üìù Configuration

**Run the game once with the mod installed to generate the config file:**

`BepInEx\config\megalon.nick_custom_music_mod.cfg`

| Setting | Possible Values | Default | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| `Use Default Songs` | `true` or `false` | `true` | Include the built-in songs when the mod is randomly selecting a song to play. However, character specific Victory Themes will *always* play, if available. |
| `Skip OnlineMenu Music if Empty`| `true` or `false` | `true` | If no song files are found in the `OnlineMenu` folder, the online menu music will not play. | 

Simply edit this file in a text editor, and save it, then launch the game again.

## ‚ùî FAQ

### "My .mp3 didn't work!"
I've had multiple people unable to load certain mp3 files.

If you've downloaded a file from a youtube downloader, such as `ytmp3.cc`, your file might actually be an `.m4a` disguised as a `.mp3`

Unity cannot load these (it seems).

Use a different converter, or convert to `.ogg` instead! Thanks.

### "What happens if I have multiple songs in the same folder?"

The mod will randomly select a song to play each time that stage / menu / victory is loaded.

### "Can I include the default songs in the random selection?"

Yes. You must enable the option in the config file. See *Configuration* above.

## üîß Developing

As of **v1.3.x**, this project requires `Newtonsoft.Json.dll`! 

You can install it with `JsonDotNet` via [Slime Mod Manager](https://github.com/legoandmars/slimemodmanager/releases/latest)

### Setup

Clone the project, then create a file in the root of the project directory named:

`NickCustomMusicMod.csproj.user`

Here you need to set the `GameDir` property to match your install directory.

Example:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <GameDir>D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl</GameDir>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Now when you build the mod, it should resolve your references automatically, and the build event will copy the plugin into your `BepInEx\plugins` folder!
